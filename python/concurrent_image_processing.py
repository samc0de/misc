# 1. Organise files in dirs.
# 2. Image comparator to start with. Take a dir as i/p.
# 3. Concurrency in this prob. Reading files from disk ans processing arrays
# can be run concurretly and both are time taking.
# 4. Start writing such concurrent functions. Profile them.
# 5. Determine # of procs and tasks given to each. Maybe a NN task? Test on dir
# with large # of images.
